Setup
-----
This project is quick and easy to get setup:

- Create a new Data Stream on data.sparkfun.com: [link](https://data.sparkfun.com/streams/make)
- Copy and paste the Private and Public keys into the agent code
- Save the Delete Key somewhere (if you ever want to delete the feed, you'll need this)
- Hit Build and Run
- Marvel at the data you are collection, and maybe build some cool graphs with it?
