FutureStack 14 Badge
====================
This is a collection of projects for the unlocked FutureStack14 Badge. You can find the original source code, with setup instructions, [here](https://github.com/newrelic/futurestack14_badge).

Electric Imp does not have a concept of libraries at the moment, as a result, the device code files are rather large. In all of the examples listed below, you can skip to the "Instante All the Things" comment, or the "Application Code" comment (as everything above those lines are essentially library code). 

Projects
--------
- [Basic](/basic) - Demonstrates how to setup callbacks for the buttons, set the state of the LED, read the temperature sensor and current battery voltage, as well as sense when NFC tags are present.
- [TempBug](/tempbug) - A low power temperature logger. Run the code, and throw your badge somewhere you want to collect temperature data.

If you're interested in working with the device's epaper display, your best bet is starting with the New Relic code!
